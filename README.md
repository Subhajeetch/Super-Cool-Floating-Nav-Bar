This project is a floating navigation bar with a sleek and modern design. The nav bar sticks to the bottom of the page and enhances the user interface by enabling users to switch between different content sections dynamically through the DOM. 
You can experience the project yourself [here](subhajeetch.github.io/Super-Cool-Floating-Nav-Bar).

## Features

- **Floating Nav Bar**: The navigation bar is fixed to the bottom of the page, providing a clean and intuitive UI.
- **Collapsible Nav**: It features an open and close button, which triggers a smooth animation when the nav bar expands or collapses, revealing or hiding the navigation buttons.
- **Cool Animations**: When toggled, the nav bar appears with cool animations, making the user experience more engaging.

## Project Highlights

- The `nav` element is styled with `position: fixed` to make it float at the bottom.
- The open/close buttons toggle the visibility of the nav bar with smooth animations.
- Took 2 days to build and perfect.
